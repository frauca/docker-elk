I'm using fintonic to acumulate all my banc movements. I will make a project to import that movements to elk.

# Running ELK

I do follow the instructions on [elastic page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-docker.html)

I will use docker to run elk to run elk run

```sheel
